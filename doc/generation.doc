Note that this works on my red hat 8 system, but it might help if you need
to add listeners.

The originals were built from j2sdk 1.4.1_02 for linux.  Including
java.awt.event, java.awt.dnd, and javax.swing.event.

To make listener modules:
cd Swing/Generate
./decomp_listeners java.awt.event /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.1_02/java/awt/event/ > decomp_list.out
Repeat for javax.swing.event

cd ../..
perl -Iblib/lib Swing/Generate/all_listeners Swing/Generate/decomp_list.out Swing/Generate/java Swing/Generate/perl

The generated perl modules are no longer needed, but all_listeners still
generates them.  Discard all files in Swing/Generate/perl.

Compile the resulting java files (remember that the Inline::Java java classes
must be in your classpath during compilation).  For example see java/project
in the distribution.  Your paths may vary.
