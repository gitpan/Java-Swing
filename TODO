Remaining problems with listener generation:
1   extends clauses for listener interfaces currently only allow one parent
2   while the same is true for throws clauses on event methods, none are
    currently failing as a result
Generate Perl modules for selected awt classes, notably the layout managers
    In particular, make a procedural interface for GridBagConstraints.

Document
    Including name conflicts unresolved and other classes unimplemented

Done
Make constructors take named arguments.
Make a small, but useful example (like the expression calculator).
Add lots more classes (possibly through generation).
Correct problems with these awt listeners:
    AWTEventListener
    DragSourceListener
    DropTargetListener
Generate the swing listeners
