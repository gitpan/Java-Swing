Revision history for Perl extension Java::Swing.

0.02
        - Completed initial documentation
        - Added a large number of modules to the MANIFEST
        - Added those modules to the packages list used by Swing.pm
        - Changed the location of the packages list in the hope that
          the location will make it easier to maintain for me and others
        - Brought in awt Layout managers.  This required special attention
          for GridBagLayout and its constraints class.  See t/05gridbag.t
          for an example of how to use the GridBagLayout.
