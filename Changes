Revision history for Perl extension Java::Swing.

0.03  Fri Apr 22 18:46 2005
        - Cleaned documentation
        - Corrected Timer class.  To use it do this:
            my $timer = Timer->new($delay, { actionPerformed => \&handler });
            $timer->start();
          do these things before calling start on your Java::Swing object
          (which I call swinger in the docs).

        - Completed initial documentation
        - Added a large number of modules to the MANIFEST
        - Added those modules to the packages list used by Swing.pm
        - Changed the location of the packages list in the hope that
          the location will make it easier to maintain for me and others
        - Brought in awt Layout managers.  This required special attention
          for GridBagLayout and its constraints class.  See t/05gridbag.t
          for an example of how to use the GridBagLayout.
