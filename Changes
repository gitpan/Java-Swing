Revision history for Perl extension Java::Swing.

0.10  Sat Jul  9 11:04:10 CDT 2005
        - Removed unneeded variable from Swing.pm for clarity.
        - Removed all but three physical Perl proxy modules.  Moved to
          proxies generated on the fly within Swing.pm.  This reduced the
          number of files in the distribution dramatically (total modules
          went from 313 to 19).
        - As part of the module reduction, standardized the listener java
          classes so they all have the same methods and always call the
          same _Listener method in Java::Swing for event dispatch to Perl
          callbacks.

        - Cleaned documentation
        - Corrected Timer class.  To use it do this:
            my $timer = Timer->new($delay, { actionPerformed => \&handler });
            $timer->start();
          do these things before calling start on your Java::Swing object
          (which I call swinger in the docs).

        - Completed initial documentation
        - Added a large number of modules to the MANIFEST
        - Added those modules to the packages list used by Swing.pm
        - Changed the location of the packages list in the hope that
          the location will make it easier to maintain for me and others
        - Brought in awt Layout managers.  This required special attention
          for GridBagLayout and its constraints class.  See t/05gridbag.t
          for an example of how to use the GridBagLayout.
